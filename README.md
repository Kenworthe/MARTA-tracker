Welcome to the Marta Tracker App!

We help people track Marta's ETA, find their most used stops and store them as a favorite thus saving them time for their next trip.

This project builds an app using the MEAN Stack. Passport is used for authentication (signup, login, and logout).

We envisioned this app to be a platform for users to track Marta's ETA and know exactly its schedule .

To accomplish this, we built a Favorite and a User Model.

The Marta tracker app makes traveling by train much easier.

The users can sign up, login, then search for the train's ETA.

For this project, we used the following technologies:

MongoDb
Angular
Express
Node
Passport
Marta-API
Heroku
npm
